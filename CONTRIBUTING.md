# Contributing to Afinidata Content

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

We Develop with Github

We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.
We Use Github Flow, So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use Github Flow). We actively welcome your pull requests:

    Fork the repo and create your branch from master.
    Make sure your content has the same style as the actuals.
    Issue that pull request!
